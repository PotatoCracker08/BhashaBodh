# BhasaBodh: Bridging Bangla Dialects and Romanized Forms through Machine Translation
## Abstract
BhasaBodh is presented as a comprehensive benchmark for machine translation (MT) that incorporates the two primary Bangla dialects, Sylheti and Chittagonian. This sentence-level corpus, enhanced with authentic romanized forms generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro, facilitates cross-lingual, multi-dialect, and multi-script translation tasks. We establish robust baselines using NLLB-200 and mBART-50 across seven challenging MT scenarios, including dialect-to-dialect, standard-to-dialect, and romanized-input translation. Our experiments reveal that while romanized input significantly aids script normalization, dialect-to-dialect and cross-lingual cross-script tasks remain particularly difficult. By providing the first comprehensive sentence-level Bangla dialect MT benchmark, BhasaBodh creates essential baselines to support future research in low-resource dialectal NLP.
